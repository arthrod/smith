# Smith Help System

Display help for Smith commands. With no arguments, shows the full command overview. With a command name, shows detailed help including syntax, flags, examples, and workflow context.

**Arguments:** $ARGUMENTS

## Behavior

This action is **read-only** — it does not modify any files. It should always be handled directly by the current session, never delegated to a sub-agent.

### No Arguments — Full Overview

When invoked with no arguments, display this overview:

```

After displaying the overview, also scan `.claude/commands/` for any `smith.*.md` files not listed above. If found, append them under a "ADDITIONAL" section with their description from frontmatter. This ensures newly added commands appear in help even without explicit entries.

### With Arguments — Detailed Help

When `$ARGUMENTS` contains a command name, display detailed help for that command.

Match the argument against known commands. Accept with or without the `smith-` prefix (e.g., both `queue` and `smith-queue` work). Also accept partial matches for sub-commands (e.g., `queue process` matches `smith-queue process`).

  high     Observed 3+ times or confirmed by explicit user feedback
  medium   Observed 1-2 times, plausible but not yet confirmed
  low      Single observation, may be coincidental

LEDGER FILES WRITTEN
  .smith/vault/ledger/patterns.md
  .smith/vault/ledger/antipatterns.md
  .smith/vault/ledger/tool-preferences.md

                                   .smith/vault/ledger/archive/<date>/ and
                                   start fresh (with confirmation prompt)

LEDGER LOCATION
  .smith/vault/ledger/
    patterns.md          Known-good approaches and successful patterns
    antipatterns.md      Known failure modes and what to avoid
    tool-preferences.md  Preferred tools, libraries, flags for this project
    edge-cases.md        Non-obvious edge cases encountered
    project-quirks.md    Project-specific gotchas (infra, env, conventions)
    meta.yaml            Entry counts, last-reflect timestamp, confidence summary
    archive/             Past Ledger snapshots from reset operations

PRUNE BEHAVIOR
  Lists all low-confidence entries with: title, category, first-observed date,
  observation count. For each entry, offers: keep / promote to medium / remove.
  Writes changes back to the relevant Ledger file.

RECONCILE
  /smith-ledger reconcile           Run Ledger self-maintenance pipeline
  /smith-ledger reconcile --dry-run Preview what would change without modifying files
  /smith-ledger reconcile --force   Bypass lock and minimum-interval checks
  /smith-ledger reconcile --status  Report whether reconciliation is currently needed

  PHASES (run in order):
    1. Merge          Deduplicate entries with >90% title similarity across files
    2. Prune          Auto-remove entries below confidence threshold (no prompt)
    3. Budget Enforce Trim each Ledger file to the configured token budget
    4. Meta Update    Recompute .meta.json counts, reset reinforcement counter
    5. Lock Release   Remove reconcile lock file (.smith/vault/ledger/.reconcile-lock)

  TRIGGERS (auto-reconcile via post-reflection check):
    - estimated_tokens > thresholds.total_tokens_max (default 30000)
    - context_budget_violations > thresholds.context_violations_threshold (default 3)
    - reinforcements_since_reconcile > thresholds.reinforcements_threshold (default 50)
    - Minimum interval between reconciles: thresholds.minimum_hours_between_reconciles (default 6h)

  SAFEGUARDS:
    - Lock file prevents concurrent reconcile runs
    - --dry-run always safe — reads only, no writes
    - Pruned entries are moved to .smith/vault/ledger/archive/ not deleted

  CONFIGURATION (in .smith/config.json under ledger.reconcile):
    auto_reconcile, reconcile_model, thresholds (total_tokens_max,
    context_violations_threshold, reinforcements_threshold,
    minimum_hours_between_reconciles)
```

  3. Push to remote
  4. Update system specs and changelog
  5. Create PR and squash-merge
  6. Verify clean state on main
  7. Rebuild Docker services if needed
```

#### `help`

```
You're looking at it.

/smith-help             Full command overview
/smith-help <command>   Detailed help for a specific command
```

### Fallback — Unknown Command

If `$ARGUMENTS` doesn't match any known command:

1. Scan `.claude/commands/` for files matching `smith.*$ARGUMENTS*.md`
2. If found, read the file's frontmatter `description` field and first paragraph after frontmatter
3. Display that as fallback help
4. If no match at all: "Unknown command: `<argument>`. Run `/smith-help` for the full command list."
